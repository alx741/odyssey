Version 0.3.1:
  * Add verification of the PIC device ID (Ian Jackson)
  * Added a new pin definition for the LVP control pin. Some programming issues
    may be solved because the LVP pin was not being set to the correct value.
  * Added finer-grained signal timing parameters (Ian Jackson)
  * Fix EEPROM data writing & reading for the pic18f252

Version 0.3:

  * Add support for 16f87[3467]A PIC devices. (David Bean)
  * Fix some timing problems when reading bits from the PIC (Ian Jackson)
  * Added some config file parameters for increasing various programming
    delays
  * Added support for rdata2 pin for programming multiple PICs at once.
    (Ian Jackson)
  * Some internal code cleanups

Version 0.2.3:
  * Mark PIC16F628 as tested; (Greg Hill). I'm getting a few reports that
    it doesn't work for some people so YMMV.
  * Some minor bugfixes
  * Added a programmer testing shell that allows you to set/clear the various
    PIC programmer signals manually. (Gerardo <gpuga@gioia...>)

Version 0.2.2a:
  * Small fix for programmers that use the any of the hardware inverted pins
    on the parallel port. (Pins 1, 11, 14, and 17)
  * Added a programmer configuration for the Schaer programmer.

Version 0.2.2:
  * Added support for PIC12F6xx devices
  * Experimental support for PIC16F62x devices
  * Minor bug fixes and some pic.conf changes
  * Added some command line options to select alternate configuration files,
    set arbitrary configuration variables, and list available device types.

Version 0.2.1:
  * Fixed bug where erase sometimes didn't completely erase the PIC
  * Added and tested programming of the PIC18F252
  * Created a manpage

Version 0.2:
  * Made the device type selection a mandatory parameter
  * Default output file format changed to 8-bit Intel hex.
  * Fixed and tested all operations for the PIC16F877
  * Added PIC18* framework and experimental PIC18fxx2 device reading support
  * Reworked and cleaned up pic.conf
  * Slight internal class reorganization
  * New sparse DataBuffer implementation

Version 0.1.1:
  * Fixed compile errors when compiling with gcc 3.2
